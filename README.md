## Dataset Description

The Titanic dataset provides information on the passengers aboard the Titanic, including features such as passenger class, sex, age, fare, and survival status.

## Analysis Description

The analysis involves the following steps:
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Feature engineering.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Univariate analysis to understand individual variable distributions.
   - Bivariate and multivariate analysis to explore relationships between variables.
   - Visualizations to identify patterns and insights.
